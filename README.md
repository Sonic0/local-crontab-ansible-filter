# local-crontab-ansible-filter
Ansible filter with a few tools to handle with crontab string.
Those tools are:
- standard_to_aws_cron
- aws_to_standard_cron
- Convert localized cron to UTC (shift hour, day or month if necessary). Standard and AWS. (TODO)
- Convert localized cron to UTC list of cron. Standard and AWS. (TODO)
- Convert UTC cron to localized. (TODO)

Probably the filter will be only compatible with Python3.8 runtime due to dependecies.
